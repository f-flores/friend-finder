# friend-finder

Friend finder is a full-stack app that searches for the most compatible friends.

## Description

This app records results from users' survey forms. Subsequently, a user's responses are compared against those of other users. Friend finder will then search for the best overall match and return his or her name and photograph.

## Technical Information

I used a node web server for this project. Express handles routing. And I leveraged Express "handlebars" for templating. 

## Installation

This app can be cloned using git.

1. Now we are ready to clone this app by running the following command. `git clone git@github.com:f-flores/friend-finder.git`

2. Since this file makes use of a couple of node modules, please run `npm install`.  This installs all of the dependencies.

3. `friend-finder` is a full stack app that uses nodejs and express on the back end. It needs to be deployed to on a platform that provides (like Heroku) "back-end" support.
